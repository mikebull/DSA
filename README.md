# DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)
C# implementations of various data structures and algorithms. Taking inspiration from [*Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*](http://a.co/48Cqup7), by Robert Lafore. Developed using TDD.

## How to Run

Currently, the best way to run the implementations is to first confirm you have NUnit installed via Nuget in Visual Studio, then run the tests in the test suite. The tests will pass. Depending on your disposition, this may be exciting.

A console, char-based visualization frontend for the implementations is planned. 

## Algorithms
* [Binary Search](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/BinarySearch.cs)
* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/BubbleSort.cs)
* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/SelectionSort.cs)
* [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/InsertionSort.cs)

## Data Structures
* [Stack](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/DataStructures/LIFOStack.cs)
* [Circular Queue](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/DataStructures/CircularQueue.cs)
* [Priority Queue](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/DataStructures/PriorityQueue.cs)

## Toy Programs using DSA implementations
* [String Reverser](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/ToyExamples/StringReverser.cs)
* [Delimiter matcher](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/ToyExamples/DelimiterMatcher.cs)
