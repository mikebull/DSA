# DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)
C# implementations of popular data structures and algorithms. Taking inspiration from [*Data Structures and Algorithms in Java*](http://a.co/48Cqup7), by Robert Lafore. Tested using TDD.

## How to Run

Currently, the best way to run the immplentations/programs is first confirm you have NUnit install via Nuget in Visual Studio, then run the tests in the test suite. The tests will pass. Depending on your disposition, this may be exciting.

A console, char-based visualization frontend for the implementations is planned. 

## Algorithms
* [Binary Search](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/BinarySearch.cs)
* [Bubble Sort](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/BubbleSort.cs)
* [Selection Sort](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/SelectionSort.cs)
* [Insertion Sort](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/Algorithms/InsertionSort.cs)

## Data Structures
* [Stack](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/DataStructures/LIFOStack.cs)
* [Circular Queue](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/DataStructures/CircularQueue.cs) 

## Toy Programs using DSA implementations
* [String Reverser](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/ToyExamples/StringReverser.cs)
* [Delimiter matcher](https://github.com/ryanklee/DSA/blob/master/DSA/ToyExamples/DelimiterMatcher.cs)
